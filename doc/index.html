        <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This is a GUI tool for running and analyzing clustering algorithms.</p>
        <h2>Terminology</h2>
            <p>
                In literature, the terminology for clustering problems varies,
                depending mostly on the application.
                At the University of Joensuu, the following terms are used:
            </p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Training set<dt>
                    <dd>The data to be partitioned<dd>
                    <dd>also known as Data set, Feature vectors, Input data<dd>
                <dt>Codebook<dt>
                    <dd>The set of representative vectors for each partition<dd>
                    <dd>also known as Centroids, Models, Representative vectors<dd>
                <dt>Partitioning<dt>
                    <dd>The mapping of each training vector to a partition<dd>
            </dl>
        <h2>How to use</h2>
            <h3>Opening files</h3>
            <p>
                Select Open from the menu or toolbar to open training set, codebooks or partitioning files.
                You can also drag the files from your file manager to the file list or to the visualization
                to open them. Files can be in the binary formats used by
                <a href="http://cs.joensuu.fi/sipu/clustering/">SIPU software</a>, or you can use
                plain text files (one vector per line, separated by whitespace).
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that partitionings are tied to a particular training set. You need to have a compatible
                training set displayed in the data view to open a partitioning file. After opening, you can
                select (double-click) a training set; all its partitionings will be marked with a “link” icon.
            </p>
            <h3>Displaying files</h3>
            <p>
                Double-click an entry in the file list to load it in the data view. Currently, only one
                training set, one codebook and one partitioning may be displayed at once, so selecting
                a file hides the previous dataset of the same type.
            </p>
            <p>
                The results of a process are displayed automatically when the process animation is played.
            </p>
            <p>
                Double-click a section heading in the file list (“Training sets”, etc.) to remove the corresponding
                data from the view. (Better UI is needed here)
            </p>
            <p>
                When a partitioning file is displayed, the corresponding training set is also displayed.
                Conversely, when a training set is removed from the view, the partitioning is removed as well.
            </p>
            <h3>Running clustering processes</h3>
            <p>
                Select an algorithm from the list at the bottom. This takes you to a page where you
                can input paremeters.
                Most algorithms will allow take training sets and initial codebook as parameters,
                you can drag files from the file list to set these. Other parameters are set in
                an intuitive way. You can also specify how the visualization will be animated.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you are done, press the Run! button to start the process.
                A movie-player-like interface is provided for viewing results of individual iterations.
            </p>
            <h3>Saving results</h3>
            <p>
                You can select a file (single-click) and choose Save As to save it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Select the Save Image action to save a picture of data displayed in the visualization
                window to an image file. Results are saved in the PNG format by default.
              <!-- TODO: SVG export
                SVG is also supported if you need high-quality vector graphics.
              -->
            </p>
              <!-- TODO: Animation export
            <p>
                The animation control screen has an option to save the results of all iterations as
                a sequence of images. Use an external program for conversion to video (look at
                <a href="http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Tutorials/External_tools/Image_sequence_to_Video_file">Blender guide</a>,
                in Linux try <tt>man ffmpeg; ffmpeg -r 10 -b 1800 -i %03d.jpg video.mp4</tt>, ... any other tips?)
            </p>
              -->
            <h3>File icons</h3>
            <p>Several icons can appear next to a file name. Here are their meanings:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Eye<dt>
                    <dd>The dataset is currently displayed in the data view<dd>
                <dt>Floppy disk<dt>
                    <dd>The dataset is not saved<dd>
                <dt>Link<dt>
                    <dd>The partitioning belongs to the currently displayed training set<dd>
            </dl>

        <h2>Development</h2>
            <p>
                Please look at the <a href="develop.html">this page</a> for instructions on
                compiling the software, and the tools you need.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to add a new clustering algorithm, look at the K-Means implementation
                in processes/kmeans.{cpp,h} and reporting.{cpp,h}.
